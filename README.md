### Description
Our project is a processing-based simulation and 
visualisation of the Enigma cryptographic machine. 
We initially aimed to code a bombe-style enigma cracker
but this proved too difficult and remains a WIP.

### How to Use
Simply load the processing.pyde file into processing and run. 
The simulation will display the step-by-step process of
encrypting "HELLOWORLD"
